        Features
        --------

        *   Admin integration for maximum usability.
        *   Group related changes into revisions that can be rolled back in a single
            transaction.
        *   Automatically save a new version whenever your model changes using Django's
            flexible signalling framework.
        *   Automate your revision management with easy-to-use middleware.
        
        **django-reversion** can be easily added to your existing Django project with an
        absolute minimum of code changes.

        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        If you're upgrading your existing installation of django-reversion, please check
        the [Schema Migrations][] wiki page for information on any database changes and
        how to upgrade. If you're using South to manage database migrations in your project,
        then upgrading is as easy as running a few django management commands.
        
        It's always worth checking the [CHANGELOG][] before upgrading too, just in case you
        get caught off-guard my a minor upgrade to the library.
